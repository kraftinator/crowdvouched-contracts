# Crowdvouched
Crowdvouched is a decentralized crowdsourcing platform for gathering data and making it publicly accessible as a shared resource. By placing bounties on pieces of information, Crowdvouched incentivizes contributors to locate, submit, and verify data. The submitted data is validated through a "proof of useful work" mechanism and participants are rewarded with project-specific tokens. The tokens are backed by project treasuries funded through donations and additional revenue streams. Solved bounties are stored on a decentralized storage system, making them accessible to all. This allows them to be easily integrated into other Web3 applications.
