# Crowdvouched

Crowdvouched is a decentralized crowdsourcing platform that uses blockchain technology to gather and validate data. Users create and manage data-driven projects, where contributors submit and verify data in exchange for project-specific tokens. These tokens are minted upon successful data validation through a novel "proof of useful work" mechanism and are backed by project treasuries funded through donations and other revenue streams. Crowdvouched incorporates gamification by turning data validation into a competitive process. Contributors earn reputation scores and rank on leaderboards, motivating accuracy and rewarding active participation.
